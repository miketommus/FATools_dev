# **'FATools' R Package Development Notes**

## Package Description

The **FATools** package simplifies the analysis of **fatty acid (FA)** data using **R**. It provides commonly used functions for processing, analyzing, and plotting FA data resulting from chromatographic analyses. These functions ensure reproducibility, traceability, and consistency in work-products generated by the **CTEL Biomarker Lab**.

## Package Development Notes

### Writing Functions
* Use imperitive mood for naming functions 
    * e.g. do() not did() or does(), mutate() not mutated() or mutates(), hide() not hid() or hides().
* Minimize dependencies and limit them to highly used, reputable, and well-maintained packages.
* Avoid writing functions that use locale or global options.
* Put the most important function arguments first.
* Required arguments shouldn't have defaults, optional arguments should have defaults. 
*  Put ... after required arguments & before optional arguments. example:

```r
mean2 <- function(x, ..., na.rm = FALSE, trim = 0) {
  mean(x, ..., na.rm = na.rm, trim = trim)
}
```

* It's important that functions are written in a way that is agnositc to data management and workflow. For example, they should accept simple data frames rather than requiring a lab-specific compount table. This allows users to change how they do thing, but still allow the pacakge to be useful. It requires them to do more data cleaning, but that's normal. Refine this idea.

## Current State of the Package

* Overall, package [documentation](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html) sucks and really needs to be reworked once the core functions are working. 
* Need to develop testing procedures for all package functions.

# **Functions in Package**

## convert_fa_name()

Function that accepts FA names in a variety of formats and will interconvert them between several supported standardized ways of writing FA names.

```r
x <- c("c16.1w7c", "18.0", "20_1_w9", "i 15:0")

convert_fa_name(x)
# returns c("16:1ω7c", "18:0", "20:1ω9", "i-15:0")

convert_fa_name(x, style = 3, notation = "n", sep = ".")
# returns c("16.1 (n-7) c", "18.0", "20.1 (n-9)", "i-15.0")
```

* ~~Needs a new name. Make it singular. Maybe change it to convert_fa_name().~~
* Needs to be more throughly tested. Someone should write some tests. 
* ~~Need to reevaluate required vs default arguments.~~
* Need to add some error checking. Use regex to look for unusual chars or unusual formats. Return which FA are problematic so user can fix them. 

## find_fa_name()

Function to search through character vector for fatty acid names. Returns an integer vector of indexes.

```r
x <- c("c16.1w7c", "not-a-fa", "sample_id", "18.0", "20_1_w9", "i 15:0")
# Returns: 1, 4, 5, 6
find_fa_name(x)
```

* Should this have any options to return different values?

```r

find_fa_name <- function(x) {
  # do tha thang
  grep("[1-9]?[0-9][[:punct:]][0-9][1-9]?", x)
}

```

# **Functions To Add**

## calc_gc_response_factor()

Function takes cross-tab file of peak area results from external standards and creates an array containing FA names & RF. 

```r
calc_gc_response_factor <- function(ext_std_areas, compound_table) {
    # accept df containing peak areas of external standards
    # require df containing prop of each FA in ext standards
    # require vector containing concs of external standards
    # Uses above to calc lm() with b=0 on each column (FA)
    # outputs df containing FA names & calculated RFs
}

# uses find_fa_name() to ID which columns to perform calculations on 

# calculates linear model using peak area & FA concentration in external standard to calculate instrument response factors. 

# returns a dataframe with FA & RF values
```

## convert_area_to_conc()
Function to post-process GCMS data and convert peak areas into FAME concentrations.

```r
convert_area_to_conc <- function() {
    # Do tha thang.
}

# read in raw gcms output (peak areas)

# split data into two sections:
    # external standards
    # analytical samples

# calculate response factors on external samples
    # calls convert_fa_name() to standardize
    # uses linear model with 0 intercept
    # 
```

## adjust_conc_for_tissue_mass()
Function to take FAME concentrations and adjust them for the amount of tissue extracted. Also needs to account for the fraction of lipid extract processed for derivatization. 

```r
adjust_conc_for_tissue_mass <- function() {
    # doit.
}
```

## convert_result_to_prop()
Function to convert concentrations into proportions. Basically all it needs to do is divide each FA concentration value by the sum of the row.

* This could even be used for peak areas, not just concentrations. 

```r
convert_result_to_prop <- function() {
    # doit.
}
```

# **Collaboration Guidelines**

* [GitHub](https://github.com/miketommus/FATools) will be the main repository and "source of truth" for the project.
* All dev work should be done on branches and then a pull request used to merge with master branch. 
* Use of Git locally on your computer for version control is highly recommended. In order to keep the commit history clean, please use the [The Repeated Amend](https://happygitwithr.com/repeated-amend) technique and only push commits to the GitHub repo that represent a unified chunk of work. 
* Clean, easy-to-read & maintain code.
